> "nasal style informed by the Old Regular Baptist vocal tradition"

High Lonesome Sound - an expressively emotional, powerful and earthy style of musical expression associated mainly with bluegrass, old-time and country music, characterized by unmetered music and use of gapped scales in singing.

The phrase High Lonesome Sound refers to the American roots music most of us call Bluegrass. It was inspired by immigrants from Scotland, England, Wales and Ireland and has borrowed many of the melodies of their traditional music.

Gapped Scale - 

    (music) A vocal technique in which certain tones out of a complete set of tones are omitted.

> 'Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he said the three-finger style was the most common way to play the five-string banjo in his hometown in western North Carolina.[8] An early influence was a local banjoist, DeWitt "Snuffy" Jenkins, who plucked in a finger style. According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka, "Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing it".'

Reno - Reno Style Picking/Playing 


	 Reno style

	 'Reno developed his own two finger "single-string" style, typically using either his index or middle finger along with his thumb, to pick a single string repeatedly, that allowed him to play scales and complicated fiddle tunes note-for-note'

	 'Reno style encompasses much more than just single-string picking; double-stops, double-time picking, triple-pull offs'
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Reno

John Hartford - if it were not for Scruggs you wouldn't be worried about who invented 3 finger picking

## Bill Monroes

Bill Monroe, 13 years older than Scruggs, was prominent in country music at the time. His career started with the "Monroe Brothers", a duo with his brother Charlie. Bill sang the high tenor harmony parts, a sound called "high lonesome", for which he became noted.[21][22] The brothers split up in 1938 and Bill, a native of "the Bluegrass State" of Kentucky, formed a new group called Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys.

### Influences
Appalachian music is influenced by many cultures and traditions, including European, African, Scottish, Irish, and Indigenous. 
### Instruments
Typical instruments used in Appalachian music include the banjo, fiddle, guitar, Appalachian dulcimer, and autoharp. 
### Origins
Appalachian music has its roots in the 18th century and is derived from British Isles ballads, hymns, and fiddle music, as well as Continental European music. 
### Development
Appalachian music has influenced many other genres, including bluegrass, country, blues, gospel, and rock n' roll. 
### Regional differences
Appalachian music varies by region, with Western North Carolina being a center of traditional Appalachian music. 
### Ballard singing
Appalachian ballads often focused on real-life problems, unlike English ballads, which were more fantastical. 
### Work songs
African enslaved people brought a tradition of work songs to the region, which were often sung in a call-and-response format. 
### Banjo
The banjo was brought to the region by Africans, who made their own banjos from hollowed-out gourds or pots. 
### Fiddle
The fiddle was originally the main instrument, and Neil Gow is credited with developing the short bow sawstroke technique that became the foundation of Appalachian mountain fiddling.
